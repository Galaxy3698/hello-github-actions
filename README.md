## Experiments with GitHub Actions

This repository started from the [GitHub Actions "Hello World"
course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-hello-world),
and has since developed into my "trying Actions things" repository.

Feel free to use the examples here, but please don't assume anything
will be particularly stable. :smile_cat:
